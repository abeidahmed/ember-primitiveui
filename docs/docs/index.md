# Introduction

Ember primitiveUI is an [open-source](https://github.com/abeidahmed/ember-primitiveui) UI component library for building accessible design systems without breaking a
sweat.

All the components are unstyled giving you the freedom to style them as you wish.

Components adhere to the [WAI-ARIA design patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) wherever possible and implementation details such as aria and role
attributes, keyboard management, focus management are handled by the library.

The library also provides a handful of `modifiers` that you can use to add behaviors to your already existing
components.

## Installation

To install the library, run:

```bash
ember install ember-primitiveui
```
